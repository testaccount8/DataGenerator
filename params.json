{"name":"Data Generator","tagline":"Primary goals of test automation should be increased coverage, decreased manual effort and flexibility to accommodate changing requirements.  DataGenerator is a new testing tool that supports these goals. This tool supports requirements specification and test case specification in terms of work  flows and data equivalence classes. By using templates, the format of the test data produced is highly customizable, and has the ability to include  dynamically calculated test expectations. The combined use of straightforward specification inputs, tool-assured test case coverage, and  customizable output enables a tester to achieve increased coverage in less time, while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to requirements changes.  In an agile software development environment, modifications to the specification input and output templates are all that’s required to get the tests re-generated.  This reduces time spent on test case generation and requirements gathering and alleviates gaps between requirements and test cases generated which  strengthens behavior-driven development.","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
